a. public static String scrambleWord(String word) {
	String scrambled = "";
	for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++){
		if ((word[i] == "A") && != word[i+1]) {

			i++;

	return scrambled;
}

Score: 4/5 --> make sure to use the correct method of substring to get the characters at an index position

b. public static void scrambleOrRemove (List<String> wordList) {
	List<String> scrambledList;
	for (int i = 0; wordList.length(); i++){
		if (wordList[i] != scrambleWord(wordList[i])) {
			scrambledList[i] = scrambleWord(wordList[i]);
