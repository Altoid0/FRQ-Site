a. public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) {
	public int count = 0;
	for (i = year1; i < year2; i++) {
		if(isLeapYear(i)) {
			count++;
		}
	}
	return count;
}

Score: 4/5  --> missing point for looping through entire range of values because of <=


b. public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) {
	int firstday = firstDayOfYear(year);
	int dayofyear = dayOfYear(month, day, year);
	return (firstday + (dayofyear % 7)); 
}


Score: 3/4 --> value calculated is incorrect, must use ((firstday + dayofyear - 1) % 7)


### COMMENTS
a. make sure to have a <= instead of just < for the comparison
b. add the first day and day of year - 1 before mod 7 --> ((firstday + dayofyear - 1) % 7)
