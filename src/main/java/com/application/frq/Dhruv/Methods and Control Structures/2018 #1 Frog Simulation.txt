a. public boolean simulate() {
	int totaldist = 0;
	for (i = 0; i <= maxHops; i++) {
		totaldist += hopDistance();
		if (totaldist < 0) {
			return false;
		}
		else if (totaldist >= goalDistance) {
			return true;
		}
	}
	return false;
}

Score 4/5 --> the bounds for the for loop must be i < maxHops


b. public double runSimluations(int num) {
	double count = 0.0;
	for(i=0; i <= num; i++) {
		if (simulate()) {
			count++;
		}
	}
	return (count/num);
}

Score 3/4 --> the bounds for the for loop must be i < num


### COMMENTS
make sure to know when to use the <= and when to use just < in a for loop as pertaining to the use case
know the difference between each and how to start the counting in a for loop.
